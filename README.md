### Machinarium Plumbing Simulator

This is an interactive simulation of [this demonic Machinarium puzzle](http://machinarium.wikia.com/wiki/Plumbing_Puzzle). It is just accurate enough to have mostly led us to the correct solution. Jesus, what a nightmare.

### Usage

Visit https://raws.github.io/machinarium-plumbing-sim. Click the orange valves to toggle them on and off. Observe how the magic liquid flows through the valves when they are turned on, but doesn't flow through them when they are turned off. Keep toggling valves until the <code>O<sub>D9</sub></code> node doesn't have any inflow. Then you've won!
